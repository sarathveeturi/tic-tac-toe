# TIC-TAC-TOE

```This is a fun project written as part of learning Rust programming language```

# Runing the project

* Follow the below steps/commands

###### Note - This is not a super fancy tic-tac-toe game where I explored search algorithms to make the computer try to win. All the tic-tac-toe board's position choices from the computer are random! Attempt here is to test myself in the rust programming language
